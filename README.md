# Tobacco Use and Mortality in England (2004–2015)

This project explores the impact of tobacco use on hospital admissions, prescriptions, and fatalities in England from 2004 to 2015 using public datasets. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualizations created with Python and Pandas.

##  Overview

The goal of this project is to uncover health trends associated with tobacco use, including:

1. Total tobacco‑related hospital admissions per year  
2. Admissions distribution by diagnosis type  
3. Differences in admissions by sex  
4. Supportive datasets including prescriptions and mortality

These insights help show how tobacco use affects public health over time.
